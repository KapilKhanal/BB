    "In order to assess the validity of the programs, a simple internal acoustics problem will be solved using the triangular and quadrilateral elements: the acoustic duct problem. This problem consists of a cylindrical duct which can be either open on both ends, closed on one end and open on the other or closed in both ends. The analytical solution can be obtained by solving the time-harmonic wave equation by separation of variables and the resonance frequencies are given by\n",
