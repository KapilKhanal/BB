# Boundary element method implementation for the Helmholtz and Laplace equations using linear  bidimensional elements
# Author: √Ålvaro Campos Ferreira - alvaro.campos.ferreira@gmail.com
# Contains the dependencies for the linear element integration.
#The main function is linear2D.solve() which builds the influence matrices, applies the boundary conditions,
#solves the linear system and returns the value of the velocity potential and its flux at boundary and domain points.
