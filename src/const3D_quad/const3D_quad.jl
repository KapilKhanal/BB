# Boundary element method implementation for the Helmholtz equation using constant plane bilinear quadrilateral elements
# Author: √Ålvaro Campos Ferreira - alvaro.campos.ferreira@gmail.com
# Module for the constant three-dimensional quadrilateral element
# Contains the dependencies for the quadrilateral element integration. The main function is const3D_quad.solve() which builds the influence matrices, applies the boundary conditions, solves the linear system and returns the value of the velocity potential and its flux at boundary and domain points.

 
module const3D_quad

	nnos = size(NOS,1)  # Number of physical nodes, same as elements when using constant elements
	# If there's a defined BCFace, the boundary condition matrix is created. If no BCFace is defined, then the mesh reader has already built the boudnary conditions matrix.
