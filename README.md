# BEM base
---
A Julia language implementation of the a fast isogeometric boundary element method formulation (IGABEM) with Hierarchical Matrices partitioning and approximation using Lagrange polynomials. 
The goal of the BEM_base project is to provide a platform that can be used alongside FreeCad and Gmsh to quickly solve bidimensional boundary element problems.
Initially, this implementation will solve the Helmholtz and Laplace equations.

## Installation
---
The project runs on Julia 1.1.1.
